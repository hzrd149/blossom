# BUD-13

## Server Public Key

`draft` `optional`

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> All public key MUST be in hex format

This BUD defines the `/pubkey` endpoint for servers.

## GET /pubkey - Server Public Key

The `/pubkey` endpoint MUST return the Nostr public key of the server, not that of the admin or user.

The kind-0 event for the public key SHOULD be published on Nostr discovery relays. `lud06` or `lud16` field on their profile would be helpful for users who want to make a zap for the server.
