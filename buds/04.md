# BUD-04

## Mirroring blobs

`draft` `optional`

Defines the `/mirror` endpoint

## PUT /mirror - Mirror Blob

A server MAY expose a `PUT /mirror` endpoint to allow users to copy a blob from a URL instead of uploading it

Clients MUST pass the URL of the remote blob as a stringified JSON object in the request body

```jsonc
// request body...
{
  "url": "https://cdn.satellite.earth/b1674191a88ec5cdd733e4240a81803105dc412d6c6708d53ab94fc248f4f553.pdf"
}
```

Clients MAY set the `Authorization` header to an upload authorization event defined in [BUD-02](./02.md#upload-authorization-required). When using authorization, the event MUST be of type "upload".

The `/mirror` endpoint MUST download the blob from the specified URL and verify that there is at least one `x` tag in the authorization event matching the sha256 hash of the download blob

**Multiple `x` tags in the authorization event MUST NOT be interpreted as the user requesting to mirror multiple blobs.**

The endpoint MUST return a [Blob Descriptor](#blob-descriptor) and a `2xx` status code if the mirroring was successful
or a `4xx` status code and error message if it was not.

The destination server SHOULD use the `Content-Type` header returned from the origin server to infer the mime type of
the blob. If the `Content-Type` header is not present the destination server SHOULD attempt to detect the `Content-Type`
from the blob contents and file extension, falling back to `application/octet-stream` if it cannot determine the type.

Servers MAY use the `Content-Length` header to determine the size of the blob.

Servers MAY reject a mirror request for any reason and MUST respond with the appropriate HTTP `4xx` status code and an error message explaining the reason for the rejection.

## Example Flow

1. Client signs an `upload` authorization event and uploads blob to Server A
1. Server A returns a [Blob Descriptor](./02.md#blob-descriptor) with the `url`
1. Client sends the `url` to Server B `/mirror` using the original `upload` authorization event
1. Server B downloads the blob from Server A using the `url`
1. Server B verifies the downloaded blob hash matches the `x` tag in the authorization event
1. Server B returns a [Blob Descriptor](./02.md#blob-descriptor)
