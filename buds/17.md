# BUD-17

## Blob Lookup

`draft` `optional`

This BUD defines an endpoint which clients can use to lookup a blob descriptor.

## GET lookup/<sha256> - Get Blob

Response MUST contains the blob descriptor as defined in [BUD-02](02.md) related to blob with `<sha256>` hash.

The endpoint MUST accept an optional file extension in the URL similar to the `GET /<sha256>` endpoint. ie. `.pdf`, `.png`, etc

Server MUST respond to a report request with a success code or a code in the 4xx/5xx range if there was any error.

### Client behaviors

Clients MAY call this endpoint before showing a blob to show previews of blob (e.g. user profiles when they are not clicked on them by user).

Clients MAY call this endpoint to preset an empty space for medias based on its dimensions so after downloading full blob screen won't move.

Clients MAY call this endpoint to prevent downloading not supported blob types and save bandwidth.

Clients MAY call this endpoint to blur sensitive content before downloading/showing them.
