# BUD-02

## Blob upload and management

`draft` `optional`

_All pubkeys MUST be in hex format_

Defines the `/upload`, `/list` and `DELETE /<sha256>` endpoints

## Blob Descriptor

A blob descriptor is a JSON object containing `url`, `sha256`, `size`, `type`, and `uploaded` fields

- `url` A publicly accessible URL to the [BUD-01](./01.md#get-sha256---get-blob) `GET /<sha256>` endpoint (optionally with a file extension)
- `sha256` The sha256 hash of the blob
- `size` The size of the blob in bytes
- `type` (optional) The MIME type of the blob
- `uploaded` The unix timestamp of when the blob was uploaded to the server

Servers MAY include additional fields in the descriptor like `magnet`, `infohash`, or `ipfs` depending on other protocols they support

Example:

```json
{
  "url": "https://cdn.example.com/b1674191a88ec5cdd733e4240a81803105dc412d6c6708d53ab94fc248f4f553.pdf",
  "sha256": "b1674191a88ec5cdd733e4240a81803105dc412d6c6708d53ab94fc248f4f553",
  "size": 184292,
  "type": "application/pdf",
  "uploaded": 1725105921
}
```

## PUT /upload - Upload Blob

The `PUT /upload` endpoint MUST accept binary data in the body of the request and MAY use the `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` headers to get the MIME type and size of the data

The endpoint MUST NOT modify the blob in any way and should return the exact same sha256 that was uploaded. This is critical to allow users to re-upload their blobs to new servers

The endpoint MUST return a [Blob Descriptor](#blob-descriptor) if the upload was successful or an error object if it was not

Servers MAY reject an upload for any reason and should respond with the appropriate HTTP `4xx` status code and an error message explaining the reason for the rejection

### Upload Authorization (required)

Servers MUST accept an authorization event when uploading blobs and should perform additional checks

1. The `t` tag MUST be set to `upload`
2. MUST contain at least one `x` tag matching the sha256 hash of the blob being uploaded

Example Authorization event:

```json
{
  "id": "bb653c815da18c089f3124b41c4b5ec072a40b87ca0f50bbbc6ecde9aca442eb",
  "pubkey": "b53185b9f27962ebdf76b8a9b0a84cd8b27f9f3d4abd59f715788a3bf9e7f75e",
  "kind": 24242,

  "created_at": 1708773959,
  "tags": [
    ["t", "upload"],
    ["x", "b1674191a88ec5cdd733e4240a81803105dc412d6c6708d53ab94fc248f4f553"],
    ["expiration", "1708858680"]
  ],

}
```

## GET /list/pubkey - List Blobs

The `/list/<pubkey>` endpoint MUST return a JSON array of [Blob Descriptor](#blob-descriptor) that where uploaded by the specified pubkey

The endpoint MUST support a `since` and `until` query parameter to limit the returned blobs by their `uploaded` date

Servers may reject a list for any reason and MUST respond with the appropriate HTTP `4xx` status code and an error message explaining the reason for the rejection

### List Authorization (optional)

The server may optionally require Authorization when listing blobs uploaded by the pubkey

In this case the server must perform additional checks on the authorization event

1. The `t` tag must be set to `list`

Example Authorization event:

```json
{
  "id": "cbb1cab9566355bfdf04e1f1fc1e655fe903ecc193e8a750092ee53beec2a0e8",
  "pubkey": "a5fc3654296e6de3cda6ba3e8eba7224fac8b150fd035d66b4c3c1dc2888b8fc",
  "kind": 24242,
  "content": "List Blobs",
  "created_at": 1708772350,

}
```

## DELETE /sha256 - Delete Blob

Servers MUST accept `DELETE` requests to the `/<sha256>` endpoint

Servers may reject a delete request for any reason and should respond with the appropriate HTTP `4xx` status code and an error message explaining the reason for the rejection

### Delete Authorization (required)

Servers MUST accept an authorization event when deleting blobs

Servers should perform additional checks on the authorization event

1. The `t` tag must be set to `delete`
2. MUST contain at least one `x` tag matching the sha256 hash of the blob being deleted

When multiple `x` tags are present on the authorization event the server MUST only delete the blob listed in the URL.

**Multiple `x` tags MUST NOT be interpreted as the user requesting a bulk delete.**

Example Authorization event:

```json
{
  "id": "a92868bd8ea740706d931f5d205308eaa0e6698e5f8026a990e78ee34ce47fe8",
