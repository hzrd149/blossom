Blob upload and management
--------------------------

`draft` `optional`

_All pubkeys MUST be in hex format_

Defines the `/upload`, `/list` and `DELETE /<sha256>` endpoints

## Blob Descriptor

A blob descriptor is a JSON object containing `url`, `sha256`, `size`, `type`, and `uploaded` fields

- `url` A public facing url this blob can retrieved from
- `sha256` The sha256 hash of the blob
- `size` The size of the blob in bytes
- `type` (optional) The MIME type of the blob
- `uploaded` The unix timestamp of when the blob was uploaded to the server

Servers may include additional fields in the descriptor like `magnet`, `infohash`, or `ipfs` depending on other protocols they support

## PUT /upload - Upload Blob

The `PUT /upload` endpoint MUST accept binary data in the body of the request and MAY use the `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` headers to get the MIME type and size of the data

The endpoint MUST NOT modify the blob in any way and should return the exact same sha256 that was uploaded. This is critical to allow users to re-upload their blobs to new servers

The endpoint MUST return a [Blob Descriptor](#blob-descriptor) if the upload was successful or an error object if it was not

Servers MAY reject an upload for any reason and should respond with the appropriate HTTP `4xx` status code and and a custom header `Blossom-Upload-Message` with a human readable error message.

If payment is required the server *MUST** return a **402 Payment Required** status code and `Www-Authenticate` header. See [BUD-06 payment storage](./06.md#payment-required)

### Upload Authorization (required)

Servers MUST accept an authorization event when uploading blobs and should perform additional checks

1. The `t` tag MUST be set to `upload`
2. The `x` tag MUST be present and set to the sha256 hash of the blob

Example Authorization event:

```json
{
  "id": "bb653c815da18c089f3124b41c4b5ec072a40b87ca0f50bbbc6ecde9aca442eb",
  "pubkey": "b53185b9f27962ebdf76b8a9b0a84cd8b27f9f3d4abd59f715788a3bf9e7f75e",
  "kind": 24242,
  "content": "Upload bitcoin.pdf",
  "created_at": 1708773959,
  "tags": [
    ["t", "upload"],
    ["x", "b1674191a88ec5cdd733e4240a81803105dc412d6c6708d53ab94fc248f4f553"],
    ["expiration", "1708858680"]
  ],
  "sig": "d0d58c92afb3f4f1925120b99c39cffe77d93e82f488c5f8f482e8f97df75c5357175b5098c338661c37d1074b0a18ab5e75a9df08967bfb200930ec6a76562f"
}
```

## GET /list/pubkey - List Blobs

The `/list/<pubkey>` endpoint MUST return a JSON array of [Blob Descriptor](#blob-descriptor) that where uploaded by the specified pubkey

The endpoint MUST support a `since` and `until` query parameter to limit the returned blobs by their `uploaded` date

Servers may reject a list for any reason and MUST respond with the appropriate HTTP `4xx` status code and a custom header `X-Upload-Error` with a human readable error message.

### List Authorization (optional)

The server may optionally require Authorization when listing blobs uploaded by the pubkey

In this case the server must perform additional checks on the authorization event

1. The `t` tag must be set to `list`

Example Authorization event:

```json
{
  "id": "cbb1cab9566355bfdf04e1f1fc1e655fe903ecc193e8a750092ee53beec2a0e8",
  "pubkey": "a5fc3654296e6de3cda6ba3e8eba7224fac8b150fd035d66b4c3c1dc2888b8fc",
  "kind": 24242,
  "content": "List Blobs",
  "created_at": 1708772350,
  "tags": [
    ["t", "list"],
    ["expiration", "1708858680"]
  ],
  "sig": "ff9c716f8de0f633738036472be553ce4b58dc71d423a0ef403f95f64ef28582ef82129b41d4d0ef64d2338eb4aeeb66dbc03f8b3a3ed405054ea8ecb14fa36c"
}
```

## DELETE /sha256 - Delete Blob

Servers MUST accept `DELETE` requests to the `/<sha256>` endpoint

Servers may reject a delete request for any reason and should respond with the appropriate HTTP `4xx` status code and an error message explaining the reason for the rejection

### Delete Authorization (required)

Servers MUST accept an authorization event when deleting blobs

Servers should perform additional checks on the authorization event

1. The `t` tag must be set to `delete`
2. A `x` tag must be present and set to the sha256 hash of the blob being deleted

Example Authorization event:

```json
{
  "id": "a92868bd8ea740706d931f5d205308eaa0e6698e5f8026a990e78ee34ce47fe8",
  "pubkey": "ae0063dd2c81ec469f2291ac029a19f39268bfc40aea7ab4136d7a858c3a06de",
  "kind": 24242,
  "content": "Delete bitcoin.pdf",
  "created_at": 1708774469,
  "tags": [
    ["t", "delete"],
    ["x", "b1674191a88ec5cdd733e4240a81803105dc412d6c6708d53ab94fc248f4f553"],
    ["expiration", "1708858680"]
  ],
  "sig": "2ba9af680505583e3eb289a1624a08661a2f6fa2e5566a5ee0036333d517f965e0ffba7f5f7a57c2de37e00a2e85fd7999076468e52bdbcfad8abb76b37a94b0"
}
```
## HEAD /upload - Upload requirements

The `HEAD /upload` endpoint MUST use the `Digest`, `Blossom-Content-Type` and `Blossom-Content-Length` headers sent by client to get the sha-256 hash, MIME type and size of the blob that will be uploaded, returning a HTTP status code and a custom headers `Blossom-Upload-Message` to indicate some human readable message about the upload requirements.

The objective of this endpoint is to allow the clients to check if the upload can be done before sending the blob to the server, checking the file hash, size, MIME type, and payment requirements if needed.

Example request headers from the client:

```
Blossom-Content-Type: application/pdf
Blossom-Content-Length: 184292
Digest: SHA-256=88a74d0b866c8ba79251a11fe5ac807839226870e77355f02eaf68b156522576
```

Example response headers from the server if the upload is allowed:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

If the upload is not allowed, the server MUST return an appropriate HTTP status code and a custom header `Blossom-Upload-Message` with a human readable error message.

Example for not allowed upload:

```http
HTTP/1.1 413 Forbidden
Blossom-Upload-Message: File too large. Max allowed size is 100MB
```

If payment is required the server *MUST** return a **402 Payment Required** status code and `Www-Authenticate` header. See [BUD-06 payment storage](./06.md#payment-required)
